Connbeat, consistent with the Elastic Beats framework, is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license - see LICENSE.md for details.

We warmly appreciate contributions, please feel free to open issues and/or
send pull requests. We want connbeat to be and remain a proper open project,
so we don't require copyright assignment: contributors will retain the copyright
on the code they contributed.

With regards to Governance, connbeat is currently maintained by
[raboof](http://github.com/raboof) and some colleages at 
[StackState](http://stackstate.com/). This is a 'BDFN' (Benevolent Dictator
for Now) model: when the community grows we're open to introducing a governance
model that is less tied to the current few contributors, but we don't feel that
need yet.
